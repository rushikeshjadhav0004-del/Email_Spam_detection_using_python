# Email Spam Detection using Machine Learning

## 🧠 Overview
This project focuses on building a **Spam Email Detection System** using **Machine Learning** techniques.  
It classifies emails or text messages as **spam** or **ham (not spam)** using the **Naive Bayes algorithm** and **TF-IDF vectorization** for text feature extraction.

The model has been trained and evaluated on the **SMS Spam Collection Dataset**, achieving high accuracy in detecting spam messages.
